## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following sections:
- Data Loading
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis
- Sales Forecasting
- Model Evaluation

### Data Loading
In this section, we load our dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. This will allow us to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently.

### Data Cleaning
We preprocess the data by converting date columns to datetime objects and handling any missing values in the dataset.

### Data Visualization
We create various plots to visualize different aspects of the data, such as sales by product, category, and customer.

### Sales Forecasting
Using the Prophet library, we forecast future sales based on historical data.

### Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our forecast model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
